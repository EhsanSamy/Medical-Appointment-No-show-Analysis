# Medical-Appointment-No-show-Analysis

This project analyzes **no-show behavior in medical appointments** using a real-world dataset from Brazil 🇧🇷. It explores key factors like age, gender, health conditions, and scheduling gaps to understand why patients miss their appointments.

## 📦 Dataset Overview

This dataset contains information on **110,527 medical appointments**, each with **14 associated features**, such as patient demographics, medical conditions, and whether or not the patient showed up.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the data
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize no-show patterns and distributions
- Identify trends based on demographics and scheduling behavior

---

## 📊 Visualizations (Matplotlib)

The current version includes visualizations for:

- 📅 Appointments and no-shows by **day**, **month**, and **year**
- 📍 Top neighborhoods with highest no-show rates
- 📈 No-show rates by **age group**, **gender**, and **chronic conditions**
- ⏳ No-show behavior based on time gap between scheduling and appointment
- 📲 Impact of **SMS reminders** on no-show behavior

---

## 🚧 Future Work

> I'm planning to take this project further with the following:
> 
- 🤖 Possibly develop a **predictive model** for no-show classification
